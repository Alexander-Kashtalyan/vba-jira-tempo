<h1>Excel Macro Tool for Tempo Worklogs Analysis</h1>
I have developed an Excel macro tool for in-depth analysis of Tempo worklogs, enabling users to effortlessly extract and analyze work logs data from the Tempo Atlassian JIRA application. This tool allows you to generate a comprehensive Excel report with Pivot Tables and slicers to them, providing valuable insights into the efforts reported by your team within a selected timeframe.</br>
Once you have a snapshot of work logs data (usually for the passed work day, but it will work for a different time frame as well) exported by Tempo Atlassian JIRA application into Excel xlsx file, you are able to get necessary extra worklogs data around JIRA tickets affected for a selected timeframe back in history (one month by default).
</br>
<p></p><strong>Key Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Extract and analyze work logs data from Tempo Atlassian JIRA application via REST API</li>
<li>Generate Excel report with Pivot Tables and slicers for comprehensive analysis</li>
<li>Run and Send the report automatically by schedule</li>
</ul>
</p>

Installation</br>
TBD a little bit later</br>
The tool uses code of <a href="https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON?tab=readme-ov-file">VBA-tools</a> project, so all installation procedures of this project may be required as well.
